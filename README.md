# Dissimilarity

Using this code one can calculate dissimilarity of a quantum state based on its bitstrings. For more details see https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09894

In the input file one can specify the following parameters:

!n_spins - number of spins

!n_measurements - number of measurements 

!dissimilarity_steps - number of overlaps to be calculated

!starting_step - step k>0 at which we start to calculate complexity (less than the previous number)

!lambda_0 - linear dimension of the filter

!filename - the name of the file containing bitstrings
